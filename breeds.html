        <h2>American Shorthairs may have descended from other domestic shorthairs brought over on the Mayflower in 1620, or even earlier by the first settlers of Jamestown or even Spanish explorers in Florida. A 1634 publication credits these domestic shorthairs with saving New England crops from squirrels and chipmunks. They were exhibited at the first U.S. cat show in 1895 and Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) recognized them as a founding breed in 1906.</h2>

In fact, they thrive on companionship, so it’s a good idea to get them a playmate to interact with throughout the day. Although they’re active and curious, they also love curling up on their human’s lap or snuggling up next to them in bed.</h2>
